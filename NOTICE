    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do

    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within

    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the

(npm 5.6.0, npm 5.8.0, npm 6.1.0)



Artistic License 2.0

====================



Copyright (c) 2000-2006, The Perl Foundation.



Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license

document, but changing it is not allowed.





Preamble



This license establishes the terms under which a given free software Package may

be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The intent is that the

Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control over the development of that

Package while still keeping the Package available as open source and free

software.



You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this license

directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the terms of this

license do not permit the full use that you propose to make of the Package, you

should contact the Copyright Holder and seek a different licensing arrangement.





Definitions



"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in the

copyright notice for the entire Package.



"Contributor" means any party that has contributed code or other material to the

Package, in accordance with the Copyright Holder's procedures.



"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute, or modify

the Package.



"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and

derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given Package may consist

of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.



"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible to

anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others outside of

your company or organization.



"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this Package or

providing support for this Package to another party. It does not mean licensing

fees.



"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified, or has been

modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.



"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such changes

were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.



"Original License" means this Artistic License as Distributed with the Standard

Version of the Package, in its current version or as it may be modified by The

Perl Foundation in the future.



"Source" form means the source code, documentation source, and configuration

files for the Package.



"Compiled" form means the compiled bytecode, object code, binary, or any other

form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation of the Source form.





Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution



(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use Modified

Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you do not Distribute

the Modified Version.





Permissions for Redistribution of the Standard Version



(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard Version

of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis or for a

Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright

notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such verbatim copies may

or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.



(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other modifications

made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting Package will still be

considered the Standard Version, and as such will be subject to the Original

License.





Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as Source



(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis or for a

Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the Modified Version)

provided that you clearly document how it differs from the Standard Version,

including, but not limited to, documenting any non-standard features,

executables, or modules, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:



(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the Standard

Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder may include

your modifications in the Standard Version.

(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the user

installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified Version

must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard Version.

(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make the Source

form of the Modified Version available to others under

(i) the Original License or

(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and redistribute

the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply to the copy that

the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of the Modified Version,

and of any works derived from it, be made freely available in that license fees

are prohibited but Distributor Fees are allowed.

Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified Versions

without the Source



(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without the Source,

provided that you include complete instructions on how to get the Source of the

Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid at the time of your

distribution. If these instructions, at any time while you are carrying out such

distribution, become invalid, you must provide new instructions on demand or

cease further distribution. If you provide valid instructions or cease

distribution within thirty days after you become aware that the instructions are

invalid, then you do not forfeit any of your rights under this license.



(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the Source,

provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the Source of the

Modified Version.





Aggregating or Linking the Package



(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or Modified

Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting aggregation provided

that you do not charge a licensing fee for the Package. Distributor Fees are

permitted, and licensing fees for other components in the aggregation are

permitted. The terms of this license apply to the use and Distribution of the

Standard or Modified Versions as included in the aggregation.



(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other works, to

embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build stand-alone binary or

bytecode versions of applications that include the Package, and Distribute the

result without restriction, provided the result does not expose a direct

interface to the Package.





Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version



(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that merely extend

or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause the Package to be a

Modified Version. In addition, such works are not considered parts of the Package

itself, and are not subject to the terms of this license.





General Provisions



(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions

is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or distributing the

Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify, or distribute the Package,

if you do not accept this license.



(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version made by

someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure that your

Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.



(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark, service

mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.



(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge patent

license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import and otherwise

transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims licensable by the

Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the Package. If you institute

patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any party

alleging that the Package constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,

then this Artistic License to you shall terminate on the date that such

litigation is filed.



(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER AND

CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED

WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR

NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS

REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY

DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF

THE USE OF THE PACKAGE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR ACME SOFTWARE

============================================



IMPORTANT READ CAREFULLY: This ACME End-User License Agreement ("EULA") is a

legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and ACME

Corporation for the ACME software product identified above, which includes

computer software and may include associated media, printed materials, and

"online" or electronic documentation ("SOFTWARE PRODUCT"). The SOFTWARE PRODUCT

also includes any updates and supplements to the original SOFTWARE PRODUCT

provided to you by ACME. Any software provided along with the SOFTWARE PRODUCT

that is associated with a separate end-user license agreement is licensed to you

under the terms of that license agreement. By installing, copying, downloading,

accessing, or otherwise using the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, you agree to be bound by the

terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to the terms of this EULA, do not install

or use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT; you may, however, return it to your place of

purchase for a full refund.





SOFTWARE PRODUCT LICENSE

------------------------



The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is protected by copyright laws and international copyright

treaties, as well as other intellectual property laws and treaties. The SOFTWARE

PRODUCT is licensed, not sold.



  1. GRANT OF LICENSE. This EULA grants you the following rights:



      * Applications Software. You may install, use, access, display, run, or

        otherwise interact with ("RUN") one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, or any

        prior version for the same operating system, on a single computer,

        workstation, terminal, handheld PC, pager, "smart phone," or other

        digital electronic device ("COMPUTER"). The primary user of the COMPUTER

        on which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is installed may make a second copy for his

        or her exclusive use on a portable computer.



      * Reservation of Rights. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by

        ACME.



  2. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS AND LIMITATIONS.



      * Not for Resale Software. If the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is labeled "Not For

        Resale" or "NFR," then, notwithstanding other sections of this EULA, your

        use of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT is limited to use for demonstration, test, or

        evaluation purposes and you may not resell, or otherwise transfer for

        value, the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.



      * Limitations on Reverse Engineering, Decompilation, and Disassembly. You

        may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE PRODUCT,

        except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted

        by applicable law.



      * Separation of Components. The SOFTWARE PRODUCT is licensed as a single

        product. Its component parts may not be separated for use on more than

        one COMPUTER.



      * Trademarks. This EULA does not grant you any rights in connection with

        any trademarks or service marks of ACME.



      * Rental. You may not rent, lease, or lend the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.



      * Support Services. ACME may provide you with support services related to

        the SOFTWARE PRODUCT ("Support Services"). Use of Support Services is

        governed by the ACME policies and programs described in the user manual,

        in "online" documentation, and/or in other ACME-provided materials. Any

        supplemental software code provided to you as part of the Support

        Services shall be considered part of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT and subject to

        the terms and conditions of this EULA.



      * Software Transfer. The initial licensee of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may make

        a one-time permanent transfer of this EULA and SOFTWARE PRODUCT only

        directly to an end user. This transfer must include all of the SOFTWARE

        PRODUCT (including all component parts, the media and printed materials,

        any upgrades, this EULA, and, if applicable, the Certificate of

        Authenticity). Such transfer may not be by way of consignment or any

        other indirect transfer. The transferee of such one-time transfer must

        agree to comply with the terms of this EULA, including the obligation not

        to further transfer this EULA and SOFTWARE PRODUCT.



      * Termination. Without prejudice to any other rights, ACME may terminate

        this EULA if you fail to comply with the terms and conditions of this

        EULA. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT

        and all of its component parts.



  3. COPYRIGHT. All title and copyrights in and to the SOFTWARE PRODUCT

    (including but not limited to any images, photographs, animations, video,

    audio, music, text, and "applets" incorporated into the SOFTWARE PRODUCT),

    the accompanying printed materials, and any copies of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT

    are owned by ACME or its suppliers. All title and intellectual property

    rights in and to the content that may be accessed through use of the SOFTWARE

    PRODUCT is the property of the respective content owner and may be protected

    by applicable copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties.

    This EULA grants you no rights to use such content. If this SOFTWARE PRODUCT

    contains documentation that is provided only in electronic form, you may

    print one copy of such electronic documentation. You may not copy the printed

    materials accompanying the SOFTWARE PRODUCT.



  4. BACKUP COPY. After installation of one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT pursuant

    to this EULA, you may keep the original media on which the SOFTWARE PRODUCT

    was provided by ACME solely for backup or archival purposes. If the original

    media is required to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT on the COMPUTER, you may make

    one copy of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT solely for backup or archival purposes.

    Except as expressly provided in this EULA, you may not otherwise make copies

    of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the printed materials accompanying the SOFTWARE

    PRODUCT.



  5. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. All SOFTWARE PRODUCT provided to the U.S.

    Government pursuant to solicitations issued on or after December 1, 1995 is

    provided with the commercial rights and restrictions described elsewhere

    herein. All SOFTWARE PRODUCT provided to the U.S. Government pursuant to

    solicitations issued prior to December 1, 1995 is provided with RESTRICTED

    RIGHTS as provided for in FAR, 48 CFR 52.227-14 (JUNE 1987) or FAR, 48 CFR

    252.227-7013 (OCT 1988), as applicable.



  6. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. This SOFTWARE PRODUCT has been classified by the US

    Government as exportable under License Exception TSU. Therefore the following

    terms apply: You agree that you will not export or re-export the SOFTWARE

    PRODUCT, any part thereof, or any process or service that is the direct

    product of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT (the foregoing collectively referred to as

    the Restricted Components), to any country, person or entity subject to U.S.

    export restrictions. You specifically agree not to export or re-export any of

    the Restricted Components (i) to any country to which the U.S. has embargoed

    or restricted the export of goods or services, which currently include, but

    are not necessarily limited to Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan

    and Syria, or to any national of any such country, wherever located, who

    intends to transmit or transport the Restricted Components back to such

    country; (ii) to any person or entity who you know or have reason to know

    will utilize the Restricted Components in the design, development or

    production of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons; or (iii) to any person

    or entity who has been prohibited from participating in U.S. export

    transactions by any federal agency of the U.S. government. You warrant and

    represent that neither the Bureau of Export Administration nor any other U.S.

    federal agency has suspended, revoked or denied your export privileges.





MISCELLANEOUS

-------------



This EULA is governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the

United States of America.





LIMITED WARRANTY

----------------



ACME warrants that (a) the SOFTWARE PRODUCT will perform substantially in

accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90)

days from the date of receipt, and (b) any Support Services provided by ACME

shall be substantially as described in applicable written materials provided to

you by ACME, and ACME support engineers will make commercially reasonable efforts

to solve any problem issues. Some states and jurisdictions do not allow

limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitation may not

apply to you.





CUSTOMER REMEDIES. ACMEs and its suppliersentire liability and your exclusive

remedy shall be, at ACMEs option, either (a) return of the price paid, if any, or

(b) repair or replacement of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT that does not meet ACMEs

Limited Warranty and which is returned to ACME with a copy of your receipt. This

Limited Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT has resulted from

accident, abuse, or misapplication. Any replacement SOFTWARE PRODUCT will be

warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days,

whichever is longer.



NO OTHER WARRANTIES. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ACME AND

ITS SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR

IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, WITH REGARD TO THE

SOFTWARE PRODUCT, AND THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES.

THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHERS, WHICH

VARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO STATE/JURISDICTION.

 

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no

event shall ACME or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,

indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, without limitation,

damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business

information, or any other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability

to use the SOFTWARE PRODUCT or the provision of or failure to provide Support

Services, even if ACME has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In

any case, ACMEs entire liability under any provision of this EULA shall be

limited to the greater of the amount actually paid by you for the SOFTWARE

PRODUCT or U.S. $5.00; provided, however, if you have entered into a ACME Support

Services Agreement, ACMEs entire liability regarding Support Services shall be

governed by the terms of that agreement. Because some states and jurisdictions do

not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability, the above limitation may not

apply to you.

      Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims

      infringed by Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by

      that Contributor.



  3. Distribution Obligations.



    3.1. Availability of Source Code.



    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in

    Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that

    Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License.

    You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code

    form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available.

    You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form

    as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a

    reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software

    exchange.



    3.2. Modifications.



    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed

    by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your

    Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient

    rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.



    3.3. Required Notices.



    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You

    as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any

    copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered

    Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving

    attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.



    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.



    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source

    Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License

    or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge

    a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or

    more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your

    own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.

    You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,

    indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby

    agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any

    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result

    of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.



    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.



    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the

    terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which

    may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in

    compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the

    Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights

    in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You

    distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different

    license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from

    this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or

    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every

    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such

    Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.



    3.6. Larger Works.



    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code

    not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as

    a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of

    this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.



  4.  Versions of the License.



    4.1. New Versions.



    Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish

    revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version

    will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in

    Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify

    this License.



    4.2. Effect of New Versions.



    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered

    Software available under the terms of the version of the License under

    which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial

    Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from

    being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version

    of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available

    under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally

    received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use,

    distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms

    of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.



    4.3. Modified Versions.



    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for

    Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this

    License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the

    name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from

    this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains

    terms which differ from this License.



  5.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.



  COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT

  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT

  LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,

  MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK

  AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD

  ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL

  DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,

  REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART

  OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT

  UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.



  6.  TERMINATION.



    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate

    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such

    breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by

    their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License

    shall survive.



    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory

    judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial

    Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to

    as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the

    Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original

    Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or

    indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly

    or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the

    Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under

    Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from

    Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of

    such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw

    Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such

    Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with

    Participant.



    6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end

    user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor

    hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any

    distributor) shall survive termination.



  7.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.



  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING

  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY

  OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF

  ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,

  INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT

  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER

  FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN

  IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS

  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL

  INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW

  PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR

  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND

  LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.



  8.  U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.



  The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48

  C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" (as that

  term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer

  software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.

  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through

  227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software

  with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is

  in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision

  that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.



  9.  MISCELLANEOUS.



  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter

  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such

  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it

  enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction

  specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the

  extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such

  jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this

  License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the

  jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original

  Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without

  limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The

  application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International

  Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that

  the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not

  apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance

  with the United States export administration regulations (and the export

  control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or

  otherwise make available any Covered Software.



  10.  RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.



  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible

  for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization

  of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and

  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing

  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in

    Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that

    Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License.

    You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code

    form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You

    must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to

    how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable

    manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.



    3.2. Modifications.



    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by

    the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications

    are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the

    rights conveyed by this License.



    3.3. Required Notices.



    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You

    as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any

    copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software,

    or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any

    Contributor or the Initial Developer.



    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.



    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code

    form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the

    recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee

    for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more

    recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own

    behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You

    must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or

    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to

    indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability

    incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of

    warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.



    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.



    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the

    terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which

    may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in

    compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the

    Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights in

    the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You

    distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license,

    You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this

    License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or

    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every

    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such

    Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.



    3.6. Larger Works.



    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code

    not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a

    single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this

    License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.





  4. Versions of the License.



    4.1. New Versions.



    Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new

    versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a

    distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one

    other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.



    4.2. Effect of New Versions.



    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered

    Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which

    You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer

    includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being

    distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the

    License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under

    the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received

    the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or

    otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any

    subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.



    4.3. Modified Versions.



    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for

    Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this

    License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name

    of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this

    License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms

    which differ from this License.





  5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.



  COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT

  WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT

  LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,

  MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK

  AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD

  ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL

  DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,

  REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART

  OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT

  UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.







  6. TERMINATION.



    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate

    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such

    breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by

    their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License

    shall survive.



    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory

    judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial

    Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as

    “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the

    Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original

    Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or

    indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or

    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial

    Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1

    and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant

    terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day

    notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim

    with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either

    unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.



    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging

    that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent

    where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the

    initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of

    the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be

    taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or

    license.



    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end

    user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor

    hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any

    distributor) shall survive termination.





  7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.



  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING

  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY

  OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF

  ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,

  INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT

  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR

  MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH

  PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS

  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL

  INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW

  PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR

  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND

  LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.







  8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.



  The Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48

  C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that

  term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer

  software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.

  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through

  227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software

  with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is

  in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision

  that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.







  9. MISCELLANEOUS.



  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter

  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such

  provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it

  enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction

  specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the

  extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such

  jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this

  License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the

  jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original

  Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without

  limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The

  application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International

  Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that

  the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not

  apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance

  with the United States export administration regulations (and the export

  control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or

  otherwise make available any Covered Software.







  10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.



  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible

  for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization

  of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and

  Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing

  herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.







  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not

provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public

licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons

makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis.

Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material

fullest extent possible.



Using Creative Commons Public Licenses



Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions

that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of

authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights

specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for

informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our

licenses.



Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those

authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise

restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.

Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they

choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary

before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as

expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license.

This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or

limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.



Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor

grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms

and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for

example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that

use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under

copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of

the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including

because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may

make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described.

Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those

requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.



Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License



By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be

bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0

International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public

License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in

consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor

grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from

making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.



Section 1 – Definitions.



a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that

is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed

Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in

a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the

Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a

musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always

produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving

image.



b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar

Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and

conditions of this Public License.



c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely

related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound

recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are

labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified

in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.



d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of

proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under

Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or

similar international agreements.



e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other

exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use

of the Licensed Material.



f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other

material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.



g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and

conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar

Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has

authority to license.



h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this

Public License.



i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that

requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public

display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or

importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that

members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time

individually chosen by them.



j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from

Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996

on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as

other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.



k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this

Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.



Section 2 – Scope.



a. License grant.



1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor

hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,

irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:



A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and



B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.



2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and

Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not

need to comply with its terms and conditions.



3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).



4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes

You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or

hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The

Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You

from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,

including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological

Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications

authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.



5. Downstream recipients.



A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed

Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the

Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.



B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or

different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures

to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights

by any recipient of the Licensed Material.



6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed

as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed

Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status

by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in

Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).



b. Other rights.



1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this

Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality

rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to

assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to

allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.



2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.



3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties

from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a

collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory

licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to

collect such royalties.



Section 3 – License Conditions.



Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following

conditions.



a. Attribution.



1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:



A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed

Material:



i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others

designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the

Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);



ii. a copyright notice;



iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;



iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;



v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably

practicable;



B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any

previous modifications; and



C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and

include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.



2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner

based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material.

For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or

hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.



3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required

by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.



4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply

must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this

Public License.



Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.



Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your

use of the Licensed Material:



a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,

reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the

database;



b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a

database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in

which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is

Adapted Material; and



c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a

substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your

obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other

Copyright and Similar Rights.



Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.



a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent

possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and

makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed

Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without

limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular

purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the

presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where

disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may

not apply to You.



b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any

legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any

direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or

other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or

use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the

possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of

liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to

You.



c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall

be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely

approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.



Section 6 – Term and Termination.



a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights

licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your

rights under this Public License terminate automatically.



b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section

6(a), it reinstates:



1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured

within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or



2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.



c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the

Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.



d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material

under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at

any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.



e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.



Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.



a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or

conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.



b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed

Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and

conditions of this Public License.



Section 8 – Interpretation.



a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be

interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the

Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this

Public License.



b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed

unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary

to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed

from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining

terms and conditions.



c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to

comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.



d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a

limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the

Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or

authority.



Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative

Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes

and in those instances will be considered the “Licensor.” Except for the limited

purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public

license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at

creativecommons.org/policies, Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the

trademark “Creative Commons” or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons

without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection

with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other

For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph does not form part of the public

licenses.

(genfun v4.0.1)



Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal

==================================





Creative Commons Legal Code

---------------------------





CC0 1.0 Universal

-----------------



CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL

SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT

RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS.

CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE

INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES

RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED

HEREUNDER.





Statement of Purpose



The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer

exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and

subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship

and/or a database (each, a "Work").



Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the

purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works

("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of

infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and

redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,

including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to

the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of

creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater

distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.



For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of

additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work

(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and

Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and

publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her

Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal

effect of CC0 on those rights.



1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected

by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights").

Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:



  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,

    and translate a Work;



  ii.  moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);



  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness

    depicted in a Work;



  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject

    to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;



  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a

    Work;



  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the

    European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal

    protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,

    including any amended or successor version of such directive); and



  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world

    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.



2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,

applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and

unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and

Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or

unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in

the Work



  i.  in all territories worldwide,



  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including

    future time extensions),



  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and



  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,

    advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver").



Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large

and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that

such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,

termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet

enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express

Statement of Purpose.



3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be

judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall

be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's

express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged

Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable,

non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to

exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work



  i.  in all territories worldwide,



  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including

    future time extensions),



  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and



  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,

    advertising or promotional purposes (the "License").



The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer

to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally

invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or

ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such

case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not



  i.  exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the

    Work or



  ii.  assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the

    Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.



4. Limitations and Disclaimers.



  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,

    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.



  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of

    any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,

    including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness

    for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other

    defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not

    discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.



  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that

    may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any

    person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer

    disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or

    other rights required for any use of the Work.



  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party

    to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or

    use of the Work.

Additional Grant of Patent Rights Version 2

===========================================



"Software" means the software distributed by Facebook, Inc.



Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook") hereby grants to each recipient of the Software

("you") a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable (subject

to the termination provision below) license under any Necessary Claims, to make,

have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Software.

For avoidance of doubt, no license is granted under Facebook's rights in any

patent claims that are infringed by (i) modifications to the Software made by you

or any third party or (ii) the Software in combination with any software or other

technology.



The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice,

if you (or any of your subsidiaries, corporate affiliates or agents) initiate

directly or indirectly, or take a direct financial interest in, any Patent

Assertion: (i) against Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or corporate

affiliates, (ii) against any party if such Patent Assertion arises in whole or in

part from any software, technology, product or service of Facebook or any of its

subsidiaries or corporate affiliates, or (iii) against any party relating to the

Software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Facebook or any of its subsidiaries

or corporate affiliates files a lawsuit alleging patent infringement against you

in the first instance, and you respond by filing a patent infringement

counterclaim in that lawsuit against that party that is unrelated to the

Software, the license granted hereunder will not terminate under section (i) of

this paragraph due to such counterclaim.



A "Necessary Claim" is a claim of a patent owned by Facebook that is necessarily

infringed by the Software standing alone.



A "Patent Assertion" is any lawsuit or other action alleging direct, indirect, or

contributory infringement or inducement to infringe any patent, including a

cross-claim or counterclaim.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 1, February 1989

==========================



Copyright (C) 1989 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA

02139, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license

document, but changing it is not allowed.



Preamble



The license agreements of most software companies try to keep users at the mercy

of those companies. By contrast, our General Public License is intended to

guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the

software is free for all its users. The General Public License applies to the

Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit

to using it. You can use it for your programs, too.



When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.

Specifically, the General Public License is designed to make sure that you have

the freedom to give away or sell copies of free software, that you receive source

code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces

of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.



To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny

you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions

translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the

software, or if you modify it.



For example, if you distribute copies of a such a program, whether gratis or for

a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make

sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must tell them

their rights.



We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer

you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or

modify the software.



Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that

everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the

software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to

know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by

others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

follow.





GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION



  1.  This License Agreement applies to any program or other work which contains

    a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under

    the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any

    such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the

    Program or any work containing the Program or a portion of it, either

    verbatim or with modifications. Each licensee is addressed as "you".



  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as

    you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and

    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and

    disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this

    General Public License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other

    recipients of the Program a copy of this General Public License along with

    the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a

    copy.



  3.  You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, and

    copy and distribute such modifications under the terms of Paragraph 1 above,

    provided that you also do the following:



      a.  cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you

        changed the files and the date of any change; and



      b. cause the whole of any work that you distribute or publish, that in

        whole or in part contains the Program or any part thereof, either with or

        without modifications, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties

        under the terms of this General Public License (except that you may

        choose to grant warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your

        option).



      c.  If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,

        you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the

        simplest and most usual way, to print or display an announcement

        including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no

        warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may

        redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how

        to view a copy of this General Public License.



      d.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and

        you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.



    Mere aggregation of another independent work with the Program (or its

    derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring

    the other work under the scope of these terms.



  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it,

    under Paragraph 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of

    Paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:



      a.  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source

        code, which must be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2

        above; or,



      b. accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to

        give any third party free (except for a nominal charge for the cost of

        distribution) a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding

        source code, to be distributed under the terms of Paragraphs 1 and 2

        above; or,



      c.  accompany it with the information you received as to where the

        corresponding source code may be obtained. (This alternative is allowed

        only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program

        in object code or executable form alone.)



    Source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

    modifications to it. For an executable file, complete source code means all

    the source code for all modules it contains; but, as a special exception, it

    need not include source code for modules which are standard libraries that

    accompany the operating system on which the executable file runs, or for

    standard header files or definitions files that accompany that operating

    system.



  5.  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program

    except as expressly provided under this General Public License. Any attempt

    otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the Program is

    void, and will automatically terminate your rights to use the Program under

    this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights to use

    copies, from you under this General Public License will not have their

    licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.



  6.  By copying, distributing or modifying the Program (or any work based on the

    Program) you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its

    terms and conditions.



  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),

    the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to

    copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.

    You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of

    the rights granted herein.



  8.  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the

    General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar

    in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new

    problems or concerns.



    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program

    specifies a version number of the license which applies to it and "any later

    version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of

    that version or of any later version published by the Free Software

    Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the license,

    you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.



  9.  If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs

    whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for

    permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software

    Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make

    exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of

    preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of

    promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.



NO WARRANTY



  9.  BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR

    THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE

    STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE

    PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,

    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND

    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND

    PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,

    YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



  10.  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL

    ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE

    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY

    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE

    OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR

    DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR

    A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH

    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS



Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs



If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use

to humanity, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which

everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.



To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach

them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of

warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer

to where the full notice is found.



Copyright (C) 19yy



This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the

terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software

Foundation; either version 1, or (at your option) any later version.



This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY

WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more details.



You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this

program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 675 Mass Ave,

Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it

starts in an interactive mode:



Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19xx name of author Gnomovision comes with

ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free software, and you

are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' for

details.



The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts

of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called

something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,

if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here a

--------------------



Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA



Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.



Preamble



The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share

and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to

guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the

software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most

of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors

commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by

the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your

programs, too.



When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our

General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to

distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),

that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change

the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can

do these things.



To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny

you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions

translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the

software, or if you modify it.



For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a

fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make

sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them

these terms so they know their rights.



We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer

you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or

modify the software.



Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that

everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the

software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to

know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by

others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.



Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish

to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually

obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent

this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free

use or not licensed at all.



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

follow.



TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION



0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice

placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of

this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or

work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any

derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the

Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or

translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without

limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".



Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by

this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not

restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents

constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by

running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.



1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as

you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately

publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;

keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any

warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License

along with the Program.



You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at

your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.



2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus

forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications

or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of

these conditions:



      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating

      that you changed the files and the date of any change.



      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or

      in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be

      licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of

      this License.



      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,

      you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the

      most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an

      appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or

      else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute

      the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy

      of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does

      not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is

      not required to print an announcement.)



These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable

sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably

considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and

its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate

works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a

work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of

this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,

and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.



Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights

to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to

control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.



In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the

Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or

distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this

License.



3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section

2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above

provided that you also do one of the following:



      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source

      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above

      on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,



      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to

      give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically

      performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the

      corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1

      and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,



      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to

      distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for

      noncommercial distribution



and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such

an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)



The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the

source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition

files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the

executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not

include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)

with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system

on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the

executable.



If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy

from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code

from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third

parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.



4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as

expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,

sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate

your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or

rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so

long as such parties remain in full compliance.



5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.

However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program

or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept

this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work

based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and

all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program

or works based on it.



6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the

recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,

distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may

not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights

granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties

to this License.



7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement

or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on

you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the

conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this

License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your

obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a

consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent

license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those

who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you

could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from

distribution of the Program.



If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any

particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the

section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.



It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or

other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this

section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software

distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many

people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed

through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is

up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software

through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.



This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a

consequence of the rest of this License.



8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain

countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright

holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical

distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is

permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this

License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.



9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the

General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in

spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems

or concerns.



Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a

version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you

have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or

of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program

does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version

ever published by the Free Software Foundation.



10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs

whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for

permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,

write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our

decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all

derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of

software generally.



NO WARRANTY



11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE

PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED

IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"

WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE

PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF

ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL

ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE

PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,

SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY

TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING

RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF

THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER

PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS



How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs



If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use

to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which

everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.



To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach

them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of

warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer

to where the full notice is found.



one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.Copyright (C)



This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License

as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2

of the License, or (at your option) any later version.



This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the

GNU General Public License for more details.



You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it

Version 2, June 1991

--------------------



Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA



Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.



Preamble



The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share

and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to

guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the

software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most

of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors

commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by

the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your

programs, too.



When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our

General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to

distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),

that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change

the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can

do these things.



To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny

you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions

translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the

software, or if you modify it.



For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a

fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make

sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them

these terms so they know their rights.



We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer

you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or

modify the software.



Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that

everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the

software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to

know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by

others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.



Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish

to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually

obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent

this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free

use or not licensed at all.



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

follow.



TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION



0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice

placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of

this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such program or

work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any

derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the

Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or

translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without

limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".



Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by

this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not

restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents

constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by

running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.



1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as

you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately

publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;

keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any

warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License

along with the Program.



You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at

your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.



2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus

forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications

or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of

these conditions:



      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating

      that you changed the files and the date of any change.



      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or

      in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be

      licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of

      this License.



      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,

      you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the

      most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an

      appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or

      else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute

      the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy

      of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does

      not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is

      not required to print an announcement.)



These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable

sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably

considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and

its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate

works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a

work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of

this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,

and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.



Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights

to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to

control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.



In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the

Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or

distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this

License.



3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section

2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above

provided that you also do one of the following:



      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source

      code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above

      on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,



      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to

      give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically

      performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the

      corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1

      and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,



      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to

      distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for

      noncommercial distribution



and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such

an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)



The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the

source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition

files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the

executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not

include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)

with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system

on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the

executable.



If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy

from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code

from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third

parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.



4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as

expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,

sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate

your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or

rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so

long as such parties remain in full compliance.



5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.

However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program

or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept

this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work

based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and

all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program

or works based on it.



6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the

recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,

distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may

not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights

granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties

to this License.



7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement

or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on

you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the

conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this

License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your

obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a

consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent

license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those

who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you

could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from

distribution of the Program.



If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any

particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the

section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.



It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or

other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this

section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software

distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many

people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed

through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is

up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software

through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.



This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a

consequence of the rest of this License.



8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain

countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright

holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical

distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is

permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this

License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.



9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the

General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in

spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems

or concerns.



Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a

version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you

have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or

of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program

does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version

ever published by the Free Software Foundation.



10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs

whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for

permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,

write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our

decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all

derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of

software generally.



NO WARRANTY



11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE

PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED

IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"

WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE

PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF

ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL

ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE

PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,

SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY

TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING

RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF

THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER

PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS



How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs



If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use

to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which

everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.



To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach

them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of

warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer

to where the full notice is found.



      one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.



      Copyright (C)



      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it

      under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free

      Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)

      any later version.



      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT

      ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or

      FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for

      more details.



      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along

      with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59

      Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it

starts in an interactive mode:



      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes

      with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free

      software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;

      type `show c' for details.



The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts

of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called

something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or

menu items--whatever suits your program.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,

if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a

sample; alter the names:



      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into

proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider

it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If

this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead

of this License.



Classpath is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License with

the following clarification and special exception.



Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a

combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU

General Public License cover the whole combination.



As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission

to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable,

regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and

distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you

also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the

license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived

from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this

exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If

you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.



As such, it can be used to run, create and distribute a large class of

applications and applets. When GNU Classpath is used unmodified as the core class

library for a virtual machine, compiler for the java languge, or for a program

written in the java programming language it does not affect the licensing for

distributing those programs directly.

use or not licensed at all.



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

follow.



TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION



  1.  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice

    placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms

    of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such

    program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program

    or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing

    the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or

    translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included

    without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as

    "you".



    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered

    by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program

    is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its

    contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been

    made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the

    Program does.



  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as

    you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and

    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and

    disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this

    License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of

    the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.



    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may

    at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.



  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus

    forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such

    modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you

    also meet all of these conditions:



      a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating

        that you changed the files and the date of any change.



      b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or

        in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to

        be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms

        of this License.



      c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,

        you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the

        most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an

        appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or

        else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute

        the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a

        copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive

        but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the

        Program is not required to print an announcement.)



    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable

    sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably

    considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,

    and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as

    separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole

    which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be

    on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to

    the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.



    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your

    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the

    right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on

    the Program.



    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with

    the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or

    distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this

    License.



  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under

    Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1

    and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:



      a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source

        code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above

        on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,



      b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to

        give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically

        performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the

        corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections

        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,



      c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to

        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only

        for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in

        object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with

        Subsection b above.)



    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

    modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all

    the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface

    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and

    installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source

    code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in

    either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,

    and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that

    component itself accompanies the executable.



    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to

    copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the

    source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,

    even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the

    object code.



  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as

    expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,

    sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically

    terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received

    copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses

    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.



  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.

    However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the

    Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you

    do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the

    Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of

    this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,

    distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.



  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),

    the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to

    copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.

    You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of

    the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance

    by third parties to this License.



  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent

    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),

    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or

    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse

    you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to

    satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other

    pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the

    Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit

    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies

    directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both

    it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the

    Program.



    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any

    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and

    the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.



    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents

    or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;

    this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free

    software distribution system, which is implemented by public license

    practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of

    software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent

    application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or

    she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee

    cannot impose that choice.



    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a

    consequence of the rest of this License.



  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain

    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original

    copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an

    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so

    that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.

    In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the

    body of this License.



  10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the

    General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar

    in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new

    problems or concerns.



    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program

    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later

    version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of

    that version or of any later version published by the Free Software

    Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,

    you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.



  11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs

    whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for

    permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software

    Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make

    exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of

    preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of

    promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.



    NO WARRANTY



  12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR

    THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE

    STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE

    PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,

    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND

    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND

    PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,

    YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



  13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL

    ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE

    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY

    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE

    OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR

    DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR

    A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH

    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS



How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs



If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use

to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which

everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.



To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach

them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of

warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer

to where the full notice is found.



one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.Copyright (C)



This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License

as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2

of the License, or (at your option) any later version.



This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the

GNU General Public License for more details.



You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it

starts in an interactive mode:



Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author

Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details

type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome

to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'

for details.



The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts

of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called

something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or

menu items--whatever suits your program.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,

if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a

sample; alter the names:



Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright

interest in the program `Gnomovision'

by James Hacker.

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into

proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider

it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If

this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead

of this License.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

==========================



Version 3,  29 June 2007



Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>



Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license

document, but changing it is not allowed.





Preamble



The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other

kinds of works.



The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take

away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General

Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all

versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of

our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.

You can apply it to your programs, too.



When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our

General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to

distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you

receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the

software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do

these things.



To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights

or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain

responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:

responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.



For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a

fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You

must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must

show them these terms so they know their rights.



Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert

copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal

permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.



For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there

is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL

requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will

not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.



Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified

versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This

is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change

the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products

for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.

Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for

those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand

ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as

needed to protect the freedom of users.



Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States

should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on

general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special

danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively

proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to

render the program non-free.



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

follow.





TERMS AND CONDITIONS



0. Definitions.



“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.



“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,

such as semiconductor masks.



“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each

licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals

or organizations.



To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a

fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.

The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work

“based on” the earlier work.



A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the

Program.



To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,

would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable

copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.

Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making

available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.



To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to

make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,

with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.



An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent

that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays

an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty

for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees

may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.

If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a

prominent item in the list meets this criterion.



1. Source Code.



The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.



A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard

defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified

for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers

working in that language.



The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the

work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major

Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to

enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard

Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code

form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component

(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on

which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an

object code interpreter used to run it.



The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source

code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object

code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.

However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose

tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in

performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example,

Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source

files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically

linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by

intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other

parts of the work.



The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate

automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.



The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.



2. Basic Permissions.



All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on

the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This

License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified

Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only

if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License

acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by

copyright law.



You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without

conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey

covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications

exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,

provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material

for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered

works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and

control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted

material outside their relationship with you.



Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions

stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.



3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.



No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under

any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright

treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting

circumvention of such measures.



When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention

of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by

exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you

disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means

of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to

forbid circumvention of technological measures.



4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.



You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in

any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each

copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this

License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the

code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all

recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.



You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may

offer support or warranty protection for a fee.



5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.



You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it

from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,

provided that you also meet all of these conditions:



  * a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and

    giving a relevant date.



  * b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under

    this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement

    modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.



  * c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone

    who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along

    with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and

    all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no

    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate

    such permission if you have separately received it.



  * d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate

    Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not

    display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.



A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which

are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not

combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage

or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its

resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the

compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a

covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other

parts of the aggregate.



6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.



You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4

and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source

under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:



  * a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a

    physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed

    on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.



  * b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a

    physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at

    least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer

    support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code

    either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the

    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium

    customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your

    reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2)

    access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.



  * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written

    offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only

    occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code

    with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.



  * d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis

    or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in

    the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not

    require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object

    code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the

    Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third

    party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain

    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the

    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding

    Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as

    needed to satisfy these requirements.



  * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you

    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work

    are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.



A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the

Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the

object code work.



A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible

personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household

purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In

determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be

resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular

user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product,

regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the

particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A

product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial

commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only

significant mode of use of the product.



“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures,

authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified

versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its

Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued

functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered

with solely because modification has been made.



If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically

for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in

which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the

recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is

characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be

accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply

if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object

code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).



The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a

requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a

work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User

Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be

denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the

operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication

across the network.



Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord

with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an

implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no

special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.



7. Additional Terms.



“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by

making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that

are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were

included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.

If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be

used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed

by this License without regard to the additional permissions.



When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any

additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional

permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you

modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you

to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright

permission.



Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a

covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)

supplement the terms of this License with terms:



  * a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of

    sections 15 and 16 of this License; or



  * b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author

    attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed

    by works containing it; or



  * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring

    that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as

    different from the original version; or



  * d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors

    of the material; or



  * e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,

    trademarks, or service marks; or



  * f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by

    anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual

    assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these

    contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.



All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions”

within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part

of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a

term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license

document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying

under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms

of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive

such relicensing or conveying.



If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,

in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to

those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.



Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a

separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply

either way.



8. Termination.



You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under

this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will

automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent

licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).



However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a

particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the

copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)

permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some

reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.



Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated

permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some

reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of

this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the

violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.



Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of

parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your

rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to

receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.



9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.



You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of

the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a

consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does

not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you

permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe

copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or

propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do

so.



10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.



Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a

license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,

subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by

third parties with this License.



An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization,

or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging

organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity

transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also

receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or

could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the

Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the

predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.



You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted

or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee,

royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and

you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a

lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,

offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.



11. Patents.



A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of

the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is

called the contributor's “contributor version”.



A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or

controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,

that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,

using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would

be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor

version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant

patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.



Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent

license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,

offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of

its contributor version.



In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or

commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express

permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).

To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or

commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.



If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the

Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of

charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network

server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the

Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of

the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a

manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent

license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual

knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a

country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe

one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe

are valid.



If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you

convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a

patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them

to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the

patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the

covered work and works based on it.



A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of

its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of

one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You

may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third

party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make

payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the

work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would

receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in

connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from

those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or

compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that

arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.



Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied

license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you

under applicable patent law.



12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.



If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)

that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the

conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy

simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent

obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if

you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying

from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both

those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the

Program.



13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.



Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link

or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU

Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the

resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part

which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General

Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply

to the combination as such.



14. Revised Versions of this License.



The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU

General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in

spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems

or concerns.



Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies

that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later

version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions

either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free

Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU

General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free

Software Foundation.



If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU

General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance

of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.



Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However,

no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a

result of your choosing to follow a later version.



15. Disclaimer of Warranty.



THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER

PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER

EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE

QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE

DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



16. Limitation of Liability.



IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY

COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS

PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,

INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE

THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED

INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE

PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY

HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.



If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot

be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall

apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil

liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of

liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.



END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS





How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs



If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use

to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which

everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.



To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach

them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of

warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer

to where the full notice is found.



    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it

does.>

    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>



    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify

    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or

    (at your option) any later version.



    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

    GNU General Public License for more details.



    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this

when it starts in an interactive mode:



    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>



    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it

    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.



The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts

of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be

different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if

any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more

information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see

<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.



The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into

proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider

it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If

this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of

this License. But first, please read

<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

==========================



Version 3,  29 June 2007



Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>



Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license

document, but changing it is not allowed.





Preamble



The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other

kinds of works.



The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take

away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General

Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all

versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of

our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.

You can apply it to your programs, too.



When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our

General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to

distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you

receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the

software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do

these things.



To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights

or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain

responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:

responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.



For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a

fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You

must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must

show them these terms so they know their rights.



Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert

copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal

permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.



For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there

is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL

requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will

not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.



Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified

versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This

is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change

the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products

for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.

Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for

those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand

ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as

needed to protect the freedom of users.



Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States

should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on

general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special

danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively

proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to

render the program non-free.



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

follow.





TERMS AND CONDITIONS



0. Definitions.



“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.



“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,

such as semiconductor masks.



“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each

licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals

or organizations.



To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a

fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.

The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work

“based on” the earlier work.



A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the

Program.



To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,

would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable

copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.

Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making

available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.



To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to

make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,

with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.



An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent

that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays

an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty

for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees

may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.

If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a

prominent item in the list meets this criterion.



1. Source Code.



The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.



A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard

defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified

for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers

working in that language.



The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the

work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major

Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to

enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard

Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code

form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component

(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on

which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an

object code interpreter used to run it.



The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source

code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object

code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.

However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose

tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in

performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example,

Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source

files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically

linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by

intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other

parts of the work.



The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate

automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.



The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.



2. Basic Permissions.



All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on

the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This

License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified

Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only

if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License

acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by

copyright law.



You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without

conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey

covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications

exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,

provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material

for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered

works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and

control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted

material outside their relationship with you.



Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions

stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.



3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.



No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under

any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright

treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting

circumvention of such measures.



When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention

of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by

exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you

disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means

of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to

forbid circumvention of technological measures.



4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.



You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in

any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each

copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this

License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the

code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all

recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.



You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may

offer support or warranty protection for a fee.



5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.



You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it

from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,

provided that you also meet all of these conditions:



  * a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and

    giving a relevant date.



  * b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under

    this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement

    modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.



  * c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone

    who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along

    with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and

    all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no

    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate

    such permission if you have separately received it.



  * d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate

    Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not

    display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.



A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which

are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not

combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage

or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its

resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the

compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a

covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other

parts of the aggregate.



6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.



You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4

and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source

under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:



  * a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a

    physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed

    on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.



  * b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a

    physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at

    least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer

    support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code

    either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the

    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium

    customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your

    reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2)

    access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.



  * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written

    offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only

    occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code

    with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.



  * d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis

    or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in

    the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not

    require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object

    code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the

    Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third

    party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain

    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the

    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding

    Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as

    needed to satisfy these requirements.



  * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you

    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work

    are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.



A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the

Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the

object code work.



A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible

personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household

purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In

determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be

resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular

user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product,

regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the

particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A

product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial

commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only

significant mode of use of the product.



“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures,

authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified

versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its

Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued

functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered

with solely because modification has been made.



If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically

for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in

which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the

recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is

characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be

accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply

if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object

code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).



The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a

requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a

work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User

Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be

denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the

operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication

across the network.



Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord

with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an

implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no

special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.



7. Additional Terms.



“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by

making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that

are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were

included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.

If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be

used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed

by this License without regard to the additional permissions.



When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any

additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional

permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you

modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you

to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright

permission.



Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a

covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)

supplement the terms of this License with terms:



  * a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of

    sections 15 and 16 of this License; or



  * b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author

    attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed

    by works containing it; or



  * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring

    that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as

    different from the original version; or



  * d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors

    of the material; or



  * e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,

    trademarks, or service marks; or



  * f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by

    anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual

    assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these

    contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.



All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions”

within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part

of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a

term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license

document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying

under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms

of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive

such relicensing or conveying.



If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,

in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to

those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.



Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a

separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply

either way.



8. Termination.



You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under

this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will

automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent

licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).



However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a

particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the

copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)

permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some

reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.



Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated

permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some

reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of

this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the

violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.



Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of

parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your

rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to

receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.



9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.



You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of

the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a

consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does

not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you

permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe

copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or

propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do

so.



10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.



Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a

license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,

subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by

third parties with this License.



An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization,

or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging

organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity

transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also

receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or

could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the

Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the

predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.



You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted

or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee,

royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and

you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a

lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,

offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.



11. Patents.



A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of

the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is

called the contributor's “contributor version”.



A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or

controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,

that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,

using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would

be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor

version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant

patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.



Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent

license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,

offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of

its contributor version.



In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or

commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express

permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).

To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or

commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.



If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the

Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of

charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network

server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the

Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of

the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a

manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent

license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual

knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a

country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe

one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe

are valid.



If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you

convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a

patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them

to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the

patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the

covered work and works based on it.



A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of

its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of

one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You

may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third

party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make

payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the

work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would

receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in

connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from

those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or

compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that

arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.



Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied

license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you

under applicable patent law.



12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.



If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)

that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the

conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy

simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent

obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if

you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying

from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both

those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the

Program.



13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.



Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link

or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU

Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the

resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part

which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General

Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply

to the combination as such.



14. Revised Versions of this License.



The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU

General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in

spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems

or concerns.



Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies

that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later

version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions

either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free

Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU

General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free

Software Foundation.



If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU

General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance

of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.



Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However,

no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a

result of your choosing to follow a later version.



15. Disclaimer of Warranty.



THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER

PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER

EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE

QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE

DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



16. Limitation of Liability.



IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY

COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS

PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,

INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE

THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED

INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE

PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY

HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.



If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot

be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall

apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil

liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of

liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.



END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS





How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs



If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use

to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which

everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.



To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach

them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of

warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer

to where the full notice is found.



    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it

does.>

    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>



    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify

    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or

    (at your option) any later version.



    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

    GNU General Public License for more details.



    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this

when it starts in an interactive mode:



    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>



    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it

    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.



The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts

of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be

different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if

any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more

information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see

<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.



The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into

proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider

it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If

this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of

this License. But first, please read

<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

GNU General Public License v3.0 w/GCC Runtime Library exception

(GNU Compiler Collection 8.3.0)



GCC RUNTIME LIBRARY EXCEPTION

=============================



Version 3.1, 31 March 2009



Copyright © 2009 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>



Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license

document, but changing it is not allowed.



This GCC Runtime Library Exception ("Exception") is an additional permission

under section 7 of the GNU General Public License, version 3 ("GPLv3"). It

applies to a given file (the "Runtime Library") that bears a notice placed by the

copyright holder of the file stating that the file is governed by GPLv3 along

with this Exception.



When you use GCC to compile a program, GCC may combine portions of certain GCC

header files and runtime libraries with the compiled program. The purpose of this

Exception is to allow compilation of non-GPL (including proprietary) programs to

use, in this way, the header files and runtime libraries covered by this

Exception.





GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

--------------------------



Version 3,  29 June 2007



Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>



Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license

document, but changing it is not allowed.





Preamble



The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other

kinds of works.



The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take

away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General

Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all

versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of

our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.

You can apply it to your programs, too.



When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our

General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to

distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you

receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the

software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do

these things.



To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights

or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain

responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:

responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.



For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a

fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You

must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must

show them these terms so they know their rights.



Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert

copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal

permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.



For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there

is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL

requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will

not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.



Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified

versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This

is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change

the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products

for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.

Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for

those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand

ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as

needed to protect the freedom of users.



Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States

should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on

general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special

danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively

proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to

render the program non-free.



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

follow.





TERMS AND CONDITIONS



0. Definitions.



“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.



“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,

such as semiconductor masks.



“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each

licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals

or organizations.



To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a

fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.

The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work

“based on” the earlier work.



A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the

Program.



To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,

would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable

copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.

Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making

available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.



To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to

make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,

with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.



An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent

that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays

an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty

for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees

may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.

If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a

prominent item in the list meets this criterion.



1. Source Code.



The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.



A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard

defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified

for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers

working in that language.



The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the

work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major

Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to

enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard

Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code

form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component

(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on

which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an

object code interpreter used to run it.



The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source

code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object

code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.

However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose

tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in

performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example,

Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source

files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically

linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by

intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other

parts of the work.



The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate

automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.



The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.



2. Basic Permissions.



All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on

the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This

License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified

Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only

if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License

acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by

copyright law.



You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without

conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey

covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications

exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,

provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material

for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered

works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and

control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted

material outside their relationship with you.



Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions

stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.



3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.



No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under

any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright

treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting

circumvention of such measures.



When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention

of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by

exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you

disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means

of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to

forbid circumvention of technological measures.



4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.



You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in

any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each

copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this

License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the

code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all

recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.



You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may

offer support or warranty protection for a fee.



5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.



You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it

from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,

provided that you also meet all of these conditions:



  * a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and

    giving a relevant date.



  * b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under

    this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement

    modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.



  * c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone

    who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along

    with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and

    all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no

    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate

    such permission if you have separately received it.



  * d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate

    Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not

    display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.



A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which

are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not

combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage

or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its

resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the

compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a

covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other

parts of the aggregate.



6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.



You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4

and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source

under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:



  * a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a

    physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed

    on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.



  * b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a

    physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at

    least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer

    support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code

    either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the

    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium

    customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your

    reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2)

    access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.



  * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written

    offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only

    occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code

    with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.



  * d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis

    or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in

    the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not

    require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object

    code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the

    Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third

    party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain

    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the

    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding

    Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as

    needed to satisfy these requirements.



  * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you

    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work

    are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.



A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the

Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the

object code work.



A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible

personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household

purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In

determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be

resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular

user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product,

regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the

particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A

product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial

commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only

significant mode of use of the product.



“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures,

authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified

versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its

Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued

functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered

with solely because modification has been made.



If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically

for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in

which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the

recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is

characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be

accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply

if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object

code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).



The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a

requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a

work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User

Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be

denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the

operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication

across the network.



Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord

with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an

implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no

special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.



7. Additional Terms.



“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by

making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that

are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were

included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.

If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be

used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed

by this License without regard to the additional permissions.



When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any

additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional

permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you

modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you

to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright

permission.



Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a

covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)

supplement the terms of this License with terms:



  * a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of

    sections 15 and 16 of this License; or



  * b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author

    attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed

    by works containing it; or



  * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring

    that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as

    different from the original version; or



  * d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors

    of the material; or



  * e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,

    trademarks, or service marks; or



  * f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by

    anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual

    assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these

    contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.



All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions”

within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part

of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a

term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license

document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying

under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms

of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive

such relicensing or conveying.



If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,

in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to

those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.



Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a

separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply

either way.



8. Termination.



You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under

this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will

automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent

licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).



However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a

particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the

copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)

permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some

reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.



Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated

permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some

reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of

this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the

violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.



Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of

parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your

rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to

receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.



9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.



You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of

the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a

consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does

not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you

permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe

copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or

propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do

so.



10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.



Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a

license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,

subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by

third parties with this License.



An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization,

or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging

organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity

transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also

receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or

could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the

Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the

predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.



You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted

or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee,

royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and

you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a

lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,

offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.



11. Patents.



A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of

the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is

called the contributor's “contributor version”.



A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or

controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,

that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,

using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would

be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor

version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant

patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.



Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent

license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,

offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of

its contributor version.



In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or

commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express

permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).

To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or

commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.



If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the

Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of

charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network

server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the

Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of

the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a

manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent

license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual

knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a

country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe

one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe

are valid.



If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you

convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a

patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them

to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the

patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the

covered work and works based on it.



A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of

its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of

one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You

may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third

party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make

payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the

work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would

receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in

connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from

those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or

compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that

arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.



Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied

license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you

under applicable patent law.



12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.



If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)

that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the

conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy

simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent

obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if

you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying

from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both

those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the

Program.



13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.



Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link

or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU

Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the

resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part

which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General

Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply

to the combination as such.



14. Revised Versions of this License.



The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU

General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in

spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems

or concerns.



Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies

that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later

version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions

either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free

Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU

General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free

Software Foundation.



If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU

General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance

of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.



Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However,

no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a

result of your choosing to follow a later version.



15. Disclaimer of Warranty.



THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER

PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER

EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE

QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE

DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



16. Limitation of Liability.



IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY

COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS

PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,

INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE

THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED

INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE

PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY

HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.



If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot

be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall

apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil

liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of

liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.



END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS





How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs



If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use

to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which

everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.



To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach

them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of

warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer

to where the full notice is found.



 <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it

does.>

Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>



This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify

it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or

(at your option) any later version.



This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the

GNU General Public License for more details.



You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this

when it starts in an interactive mode:



 <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>



This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.

This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it

under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.



The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts

of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be

different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if

any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more

information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see

<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.



The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into

proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider

it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If

this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of

this License. But first, please read

<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

      the version number 2.1.]





Preamble

--------



The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share

and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to

guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the

software is free for all its users.



This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially

designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software

Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we

suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary

General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,

based on the explanations below.



When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.

Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom

to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);

that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change

the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed

that you can do these things.



To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to

deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions

translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the

library or if you modify it.



For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a

fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make

sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code

with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so

that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library

and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.



We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and

(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,

distribute and/or modify the library.



To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no

warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else

and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original

version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by

problems that might be introduced by others.



Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free

program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the

users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.

Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the

library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this

license.



Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU

General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,

applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary

General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to

permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.



When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared

library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a

derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore

permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.

The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other

code with the library.



We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to

protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also

provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing

non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General

Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides

advantages in certain special circumstances.



For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the

widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.

To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more

frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free

libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to

free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.



In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs

enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For

example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many

more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the

GNU/Linux operating system.



Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'

freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the

Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified

version of the Library.



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the

library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived

from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order

to run.





TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

---------------------------------------------------------------



0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which

contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying

it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also

called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".



A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as

to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those

functions and data) to form executables.



The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been

distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the

Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work

containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications

and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,

translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)



"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source

code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,

plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.



Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by

this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the

Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its

contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the

Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the

Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.



1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source

code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and

appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer

of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the

absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the

Library.



You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at

your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.



2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus

forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications

or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of

these conditions:



      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.



      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating

      that you changed the files and the date of any change.



      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all

      third parties under the terms of this License.



      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of

      data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other

      than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make

      a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not

      supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs

      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.



      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose

      that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,

      Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used

      by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,

      the square root function must still compute square roots.)



      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable

      sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be

      reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then

      this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you

      distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same

      sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the

      distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose

      permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to

      each and every part regardless of who wrote it.



      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your

      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise

      the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works

      based on the Library.



      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with

      the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage

      or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of

      this License.



3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License

instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must

alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the

ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a

newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has

appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any

other change in these notices.



Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so

the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and

derivative works made from that copy.



This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into

a program that is not a library.



4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,

under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1

and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding

machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of

Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.



If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a

designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from

the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even

though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object

code.



5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is

designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called

a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative

work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.



However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an

executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of

the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is

therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of

such executables.



When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part

of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the

Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially

significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is

itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by

law.



If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and

accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in

length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether

it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus

portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)



Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the

object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing

that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with

the Library itself.



6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work

that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of

the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that

the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse

engineering for debugging such modifications.



You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is

used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must

supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright

notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as

well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you

must do one of these things:



      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable

      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the

      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the

      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete

      machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source

      code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a

      modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that

      the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will

      not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified

      definitions.)



      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A

      suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library

      already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library

      functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a

      modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the

      modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was

      made with.



      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,

      to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for

      a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.



      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a

      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified

      materials from the same place.



      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or

      that you have already sent this user a copy.



For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must

include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from

it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not

include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)

with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system

on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the

executable.



It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other

proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a

contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an

executable that you distribute.



7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library

side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not

covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that

the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other

library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two

things:



      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the

      Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be

      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.



      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of

      it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the

      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.



8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library

except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,

modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will

automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have

received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their

licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.



9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.

However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library

or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept

this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work

based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and

all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library

or works based on it.



10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),

the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to

copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and

conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'

exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing

compliance by third parties with this License.



11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement

or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on

you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the

conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this

License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your

obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a

consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent

license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those

who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you

could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from

distribution of the Library.



If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any

particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the

section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.



It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or

other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this

section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software

distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people

have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed

through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is

up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software

through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.



This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a

consequence of the rest of this License.



12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain

countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright

holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical

distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is

permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this

License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.



13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the

Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be

similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new

problems or concerns.



Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a

version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you

have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or

of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library

does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever

published by the Free Software Foundation.



14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs

whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to

ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software

Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions

for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free

status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and

reuse of software generally.



NO WARRANTY



15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE

LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED

IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS"

WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE

LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF

ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL

ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE

LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,

SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY

TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING

RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF

THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER

PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.





END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS





How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

----------------------------------------------



If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use

to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can

redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these

terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public

License).



To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest

to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the

exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line

and a pointer to where the full notice is found.



      one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.



      Copyright (C) year name of author



      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or



      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public



      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either



      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.



      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,



      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of



      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU



      Lesser General Public License for more details.



      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public



      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software



      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,

if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a

sample; alter the names:



      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in



      the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written

suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary

General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,

based on the explanations below.



When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.

Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom

to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);

that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change

the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed

that you can do these things.



To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to

deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions

translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the

library or if you modify it.



For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a

fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make

sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code

with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so

that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library

and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.



We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and

(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,

distribute and/or modify the library.



To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no

warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else

and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original

version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected by

problems that might be introduced by others.



Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free

program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the

users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.

Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the

library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this

license.



Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU

General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,

applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary

General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in order to

permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.



When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared

library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a

derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License therefore

permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.

The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other

code with the library.



We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to

protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also

provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing

non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General

Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides

advantages in certain special circumstances.



For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the

widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.

To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more

frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free

libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to

free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.



In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs

enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For

example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many

more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the

GNU/Linux operating system.



Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'

freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the

Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified

version of the Library.



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the

library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived

from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order

to run.





TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

---------------------------------------------------------------



0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which

contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying

it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also

called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".



A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as

to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those

functions and data) to form executables.



The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been

distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the

Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work

containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications

and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,

translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)



"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source

code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,

plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.



Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by

this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the

Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its

contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the

Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the

Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.



1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source

code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and

appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer

of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the

absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the

Library.



You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at

your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.



2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus

forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications

or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of

these conditions:



      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.



      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating

      that you changed the files and the date of any change.



      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all

      third parties under the terms of this License.



      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of

      data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other

      than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make

      a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not

      supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs

      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.



      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose

      that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,

      Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used

      by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,

      the square root function must still compute square roots.)



      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable

      sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be

      reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then

      this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you

      distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same

      sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the

      distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose

      permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to

      each and every part regardless of who wrote it.



      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your

      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise

      the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works

      based on the Library.



      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with

      the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage

      or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of

      this License.



3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License

instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must

alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the

ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a

newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has

appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any

other change in these notices.



Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so

the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and

derivative works made from that copy.



This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into

a program that is not a library.



4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,

under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1

and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding

machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of

Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.



If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a

designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from

the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even

though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object

code.



5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is

designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called

a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative

work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.



However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an

executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of

the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is

therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of

such executables.



When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part

of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the

Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially

significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is

itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by

law.



If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and

accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in

length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether

it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus

portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)



Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the

object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing

that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with

the Library itself.



6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work

that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of

the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that

the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse

engineering for debugging such modifications.



You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is

used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must

supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright

notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as

well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you

must do one of these things:



      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable

      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the

      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the

      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete

      machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source

      code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a

      modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that

      the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will

      not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified

      definitions.)



      b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A

      suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library

      already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library

      functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a

      modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the

      modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was

      made with.



      c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,

      to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for

      a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.



      d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a

      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified

      materials from the same place.



      e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or

      that you have already sent this user a copy.



For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must

include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from

it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not

include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)

with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system

on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the

executable.



It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other

proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a

contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an

executable that you distribute.



7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library

side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not

covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that

the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other

library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two

things:



      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the

      Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be

      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.



      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of

      it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the

      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.



8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library

except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,

modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will

automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have

received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their

licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.



9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.

However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library

or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept

this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work

based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and

all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library

or works based on it.



10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),

the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to

copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and

conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'

exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing

compliance by third parties with this License.



11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement

or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on

you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the

conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this

License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your

obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a

consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent

license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those

who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you

could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from

distribution of the Library.



If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any

particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the

section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.



It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or

other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this

section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software

distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people

have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed

through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is

up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software

through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.



This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a

consequence of the rest of this License.



12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain

countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright

holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical

distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is

permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this

License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.



13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the

Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be

similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new

problems or concerns.



Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a

version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you

have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or

of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library

does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever

published by the Free Software Foundation.



14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs

whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to

ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software

Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions

for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free

status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and

reuse of software generally.



NO WARRANTY



15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE

LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED

IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS"

WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE

LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF

ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL

ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE

LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,

SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY

TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING

RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF

THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER

PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.





END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS





How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

----------------------------------------------



If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use

to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can

redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these

terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public

License).



To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest

to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the

exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line

and a pointer to where the full notice is found.



      one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.



      Copyright (C) year name of author



      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or



      modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public



      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either



      version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.



      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,



      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of



      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU



      Lesser General Public License for more details.



      You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public



      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software



      Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,

if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a

sample; alter the names:



      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in



      the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written



      by James Random Hacker.



      signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990



      Ty Coon, President of Vice



That's all there is to it!

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

=================================



Version 3,  29 June 2007



Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>



Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license

document, but changing it is not allowed.



This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and

conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the

additional permissions listed below.



0. Additional Definitions.



As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General

Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public

License.



“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an

Application or a Combined Work as defined below.



An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the

Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of

a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by

the Library.



A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with

the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work

was made is also called the “Linked Version”.



The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding

Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the

Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and

not on the Linked Version.



The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code

and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs

needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the

System Libraries of the Combined Work.



1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.



You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without

being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.



2. Conveying Modified Versions.



If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility

refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the

facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then

you may convey a copy of the modified version:



  * a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure

    that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the

    facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains

    meaningful, or



  * b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License

    applicable to that copy.



3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.



The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header

file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of

your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to

numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,

inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the

following:



  * a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library

    is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.



  * b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license

    document.



4. Combined Works.



You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together,

effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained

in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if

you also do each of the following:



  * a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library

    is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.



  * b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license

    document.



  * c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,

    include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as

    a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license

    document.



  * d) Do one of the following:



      * 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this

        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for,

        and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the

        Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a

        modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU

        GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.



      * 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.

        A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the

        Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will

        operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is

        interface-compatible with the Linked Version.



  * e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be

    required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only

    to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a

    modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking

    the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use

    option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal

    Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option

    4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by

    section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)



5. Combined Libraries.



You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by

side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not

Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined

library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:



  * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the

    Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the

    terms of this License.



  * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work

    based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying

    uncombined form of the same work.



6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.



The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU

Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be

similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new

problems or concerns.



Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you

received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General

Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of

following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any

later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you

received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public

License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever

published by the Free Software Foundation.



If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether

future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that

proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization

for you to choose that version for the Library.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

==========================



Version 3,  29 June 2007



Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>



Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license

document, but changing it is not allowed.





Preamble



The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other

kinds of works.



The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take

away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General

Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all

versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of

our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.

You can apply it to your programs, too.



When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our

General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to

distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you

receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the

software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do

these things.



To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights

or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain

responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:

responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.



For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a

fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You

must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must

show them these terms so they know their rights.



Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert

copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal

permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.



For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there

is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL

requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will

not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.



Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified

versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This

is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change

the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products

for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.

Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for

those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand

ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as

needed to protect the freedom of users.



Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States

should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on

general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special

danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively

proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to

render the program non-free.



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

follow.





TERMS AND CONDITIONS



0. Definitions.



“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.



“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,

such as semiconductor masks.



“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each

licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals

or organizations.



To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a

fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.

The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work

“based on” the earlier work.



A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the

Program.



To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,

would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable

copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.

Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making

available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.



To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to

make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,

with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.



An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the extent

that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays

an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty

for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees

may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.

If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a

prominent item in the list meets this criterion.



1. Source Code.



The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.



A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official standard

defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified

for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers

working in that language.



The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than the

work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major

Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to

enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard

Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code

form. A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component

(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on

which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an

object code interpreter used to run it.



The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source

code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object

code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.

However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose

tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in

performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example,

Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source

files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically

linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by

intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other

parts of the work.



The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate

automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.



The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.



2. Basic Permissions.



All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on

the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This

License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified

Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only

if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License

acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by

copyright law.



You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without

conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey

covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications

exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,

provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material

for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered

works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and

control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted

material outside their relationship with you.



Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions

stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.



3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.



No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under

any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright

treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting

circumvention of such measures.



When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention

of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by

exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you

disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means

of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to

forbid circumvention of technological measures.



4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.



You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in

any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each

copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this

License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the

code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all

recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.



You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may

offer support or warranty protection for a fee.



5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.



You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it

from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,

provided that you also meet all of these conditions:



  * a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and

    giving a relevant date.



  * b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under

    this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement

    modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.



  * c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone

    who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along

    with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and

    all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no

    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate

    such permission if you have separately received it.



  * d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate

    Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not

    display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.



A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which

are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not

combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage

or distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its

resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the

compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a

covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other

parts of the aggregate.



6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.



You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4

and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source

under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:



  * a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a

    physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed

    on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.



  * b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a

    physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at

    least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer

    support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code

    either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the

    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium

    customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your

    reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2)

    access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.



  * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written

    offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only

    occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code

    with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.



  * d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis

    or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in

    the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not

    require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object

    code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the

    Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third

    party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain

    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the

    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding

    Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as

    needed to satisfy these requirements.



  * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you

    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work

    are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.



A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the

Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the

object code work.



A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any tangible

personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household

purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In

determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be

resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular

user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of product,

regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the

particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A

product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial

commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only

significant mode of use of the product.



“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods, procedures,

authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified

versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its

Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued

functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered

with solely because modification has been made.



If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically

for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in

which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the

recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is

characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be

accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply

if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object

code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).



The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a

requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a

work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User

Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be

denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the

operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication

across the network.



Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord

with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an

implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no

special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.



7. Additional Terms.



“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this License by

making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that

are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were

included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.

If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be

used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed

by this License without regard to the additional permissions.



When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any

additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional

permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you

modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you

to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright

permission.



Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a

covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)

supplement the terms of this License with terms:



  * a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of

    sections 15 and 16 of this License; or



  * b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author

    attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed

    by works containing it; or



  * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring

    that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as

    different from the original version; or



  * d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors

    of the material; or



  * e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,

    trademarks, or service marks; or



  * f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by

    anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual

    assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these

    contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.



All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further restrictions”

within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part

of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a

term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license

document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying

under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms

of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive

such relicensing or conveying.



If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,

in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to

those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.



Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a

separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply

either way.



8. Termination.



You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under

this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will

automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent

licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).



However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a

particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the

copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)

permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some

reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.



Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated

permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some

reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of

this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the

violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.



Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of

parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your

rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to

receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.



9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.



You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of

the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a

consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does

not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you

permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe

copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or

propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do

so.



10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.



Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a

license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,

subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by

third parties with this License.



An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an organization,

or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging

organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity

transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also

receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or

could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the

Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the

predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.



You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted

or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee,

royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and

you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a

lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,

offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.



11. Patents.



A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of

the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is

called the contributor's “contributor version”.



A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or

controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,

that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,

using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would

be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor

version. For purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant

patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.



Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent

license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,

offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of

its contributor version.



In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express agreement or

commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express

permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).

To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or

commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.



If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the

Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of

charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network

server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the

Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of

the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a

manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent

license to downstream recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual

knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a

country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe

one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe

are valid.



If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you

convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a

patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them

to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the

patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the

covered work and works based on it.



A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the scope of

its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of

one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You

may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third

party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make

payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the

work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would

receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in

connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from

those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or

compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that

arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.



Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied

license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you

under applicable patent law.



12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.



If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)

that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the

conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy

simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent

obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if

you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying

from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both

those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the

Program.



13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.



Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link

or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU

Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the

resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part

which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General

Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply

to the combination as such.



14. Revised Versions of this License.



The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU

General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in

spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems

or concerns.



Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies

that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later

version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions

either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free

Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU

General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free

Software Foundation.



If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU

General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance

of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.



Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However,

no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a

result of your choosing to follow a later version.



15. Disclaimer of Warranty.



THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER

PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER

EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF

MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE

QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE

DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



16. Limitation of Liability.



IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY

COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS

PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,

INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE

THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED

INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE

PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY

HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.



If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot

be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall

apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil

liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of

liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.



END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS





How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs



If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use

to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which

everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.



To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach

them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of

warranty; and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer

to where the full notice is found.



    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it

does.>

    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>



    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify

    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or

    (at your option) any later version.



    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the

    GNU General Public License for more details.



    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this

when it starts in an interactive mode:



    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>



    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.

    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it

    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.



The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts

of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be

different; for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if

any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more

information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see

<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.



The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into

proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider

it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If

this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of

this License. But first, please read

<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

      59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA



      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

Preamble

--------



The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share

and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to

guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the

software is free for all its users.



This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially

designated Free Software Foundation software, and to other libraries whose

authors who decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries too.



When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our

General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to

distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),

that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change

the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can

do these things.



To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny

you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions

translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the

library, or if you modify it.



For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a

fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make

sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program

with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so

that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library

and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.



Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library,

and (2) offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,

distribute and/or modify the library.



Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone

understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is

modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what

they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others

will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.



Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish

to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually

obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary

software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed

for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.



Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU

General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license,

the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries.

This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in

full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary

license.



The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur

the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and

simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library,

is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility

program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked

executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the

ordinary General Public License treats it as such.



Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License

for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most

developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might

promote sharing better.



However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of

those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves.

This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free

programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such

programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not

seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved

it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that

this will lead to faster development of free libraries.



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the

library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived

from the library, while the latter only works together with the library.



Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General

Public License rather than by this special one.





TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

---------------------------------------------------------------



0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice

placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be

distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called

"this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".



A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as

to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those

functions and data) to form executables.



The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been

distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the

Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work

containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications

and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,

translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)



"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source

code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files,

plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.



Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by

this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the

Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its

contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the

Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the

Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.



1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source

code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and

appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer

of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the

absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the

Library.



You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at

your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.



2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus

forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications

or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of

these conditions:



      a) The modified work must itself be a software library.



      b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating

      that you changed the files and the date of any change.



      c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all

      third parties under the terms of this License.



      d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of

      data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other

      than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make

      a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not

      supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs

      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.



      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose

      that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,

      Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used

      by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it,

      the square root function must still compute square roots.)



      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable

      sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be

      reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then

      this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you

      distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same

      sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the

      distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose

      permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to

      each and every part regardless of who wrote it.



      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your

      rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise

      the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works

      based on the Library.



      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with

      the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage

      or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of

      this License.



3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License

instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must

alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the

ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a

newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has

appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any

other change in these notices.



Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so

the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and

derivative works made from that copy.



This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into

a program that is not a library.



4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,

under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1

and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding

machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of

Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.



If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a

designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from

the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even

though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object

code.



5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is

designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called

a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative

work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.



However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an

executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of

the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is

therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of

such executables.



When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part

of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the

Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially

significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is

itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by

law.



If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and

accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in

length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether

it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus

portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)



Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the

object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing

that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with

the Library itself.



6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a "work

that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of

the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that

the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse

engineering for debugging such modifications.



You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is

used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must

supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright

notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as

well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you

must do one of these things:



      a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable

      source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the

      work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the

      work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete

      machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source

      code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a

      modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that

      the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will

      not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified

      definitions.)



      b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years,

      to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for

      a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.



      c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a

      designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified

      materials from the same place.



      d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or

      that you have already sent this user a copy.



For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must

include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from

it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include

anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the

major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which

the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.



It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other

proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a

contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an

executable that you distribute.



7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library

side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not

covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that

the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other

library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two

things:



      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the

      Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be

      distributed under the terms of the Sections above.



      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of

      it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the

      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.



8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library

except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,

modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will

automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have

received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their

licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.



9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.

However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library

or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept

this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work

based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and

all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library

or works based on it.



10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),

the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to

copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and

conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'

exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing

compliance by third parties to this License.



11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement

or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on

you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the

conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this

License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your

obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a

consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent

license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those

who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you

could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from

distribution of the Library.



If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any

particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the

section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.



It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or

other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this

section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software

distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people

have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed

through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is

up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software

through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.



This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a

consequence of the rest of this License.



12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain

countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright

holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical

distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is

permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this

License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.



13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the

Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be

similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new

problems or concerns.



Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a

version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you

have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or

of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library

does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever

published by the Free Software Foundation.



14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs

whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to

ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software

Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions

for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free

status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and

reuse of software generally.



NO WARRANTY



15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE

LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED

IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS"

WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A

PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE

LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF

ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL

ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE

LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,

SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY

TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING

RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF

THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER

PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.





END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS





How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

----------------------------------------------



If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use

to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can

redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these

terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public

License).



To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest

to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the

exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line

and a pointer to where the full notice is found.



      one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.



      Copyright (C) year name of author



      This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or



      modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public



      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either



      version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.



      This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,



      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of



      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU



      Library General Public License for more details.



      You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public



      License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software



      Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,

if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is a

sample; alter the names:



      Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in



      the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written



      by James Random Hacker.



      signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1990

Independent JPEG Group License

(OpenJDK 1.8.0.212.b04)



The Independent JPEG Group's JPEG software

==========================================



README for release 6b of 27-Mar-1998

====================================



This distribution contains the sixth public release of the Independent JPEG

Group's free JPEG software. You are welcome to redistribute this software and to

use it for any purpose, subject to the conditions under LEGAL ISSUES, below.



Serious users of this software (particularly those incorporating it into larger

programs) should contact IJG at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net to be added to our

electronic mailing list. Mailing list members are notified of updates and have a

chance to participate in technical discussions, etc.



This software is the work of Tom Lane, Philip Gladstone, Jim Boucher, Lee

Crocker, Julian Minguillon, Luis Ortiz, George Phillips, Davide Rossi, Guido

Vollbeding, Ge' Weijers, and other members of the Independent JPEG Group.



IJG is not affiliated with the official ISO JPEG standards committee.



LEGAL ISSUES

============



In plain English:



  1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please

    let us know!)



  2.  You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us.



  3.  You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a

    program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've

    used the IJG code.



In legalese:



The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied, with

respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or fitness for

a particular purpose. This software is provided "AS IS", and you, its user,

assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.



This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights Reserved

except as specified below.



Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software

(or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions:



(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this

README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice

unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be

clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.



(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation

must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent

JPEG Group".



(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full

responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY

for damages of any kind.



These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not

just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.



Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name in

advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from it.

This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's software".



We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of

commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are assumed

by the product vendor.



ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,

sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.

ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by

the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally, that

you must include source code if you redistribute it. (See the file ansi2knr.c for

full details.) However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part of any program

generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing

paragraphs do.



The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf. It is

copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable. The same

holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh).

Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely

distributable.



It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by

patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding cannot

legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this reason, support

for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software. (Since

arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented Huffman mode,

it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.) So far as we are

aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code.



The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. To avoid

entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has been removed

altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce "uncompressed

GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the resulting GIF files are

larger than usual, but are readable by all standard GIF decoders.



We are required to state that



  "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of CompuServe

  Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of CompuServe Incorporated."

--------------------------------





  2.1. Grants



  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive

  license:



    a. 



      under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)

      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify,

    b. 



      under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale,

      have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its

      Contributor Version.





  2.2. Effective Date



  The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become

  effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes

  such Contribution.





  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope



  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this

  License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution

  or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding

  Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:



    a. 



      for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or



    b. 



      for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's

      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its

      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor

      Version); or



    c. 



      under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its

      Contributions.



  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or

  logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice

  requirements in Section 3.4).





  2.4. Subsequent Licenses



  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute

  the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see

  Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the

  terms of Section 3.3).





  2.5. Representation



  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are

  its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its

  Contributions conveyed by this License.





  2.6. Fair Use



  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable

  copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.





  2.7. Conditions



  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in

  Section 2.1.





3. Responsibilities

-------------------





  3.1. Distribution of Source Form



  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any

  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the

  terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of

  the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can

  obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the

  recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.





  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form



  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:



    a. 



      such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as

      described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable

      Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable

      means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution

      to the recipient; and



    b. 



      You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or

      sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the

      Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights

      in the Source Code Form under this License.





  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work



  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,

  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the

  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with

  a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is

  not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to

  additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary

  License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,

  further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License

  or such Secondary License(s).





  3.4. Notices



  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including

  copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of

  liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,

  except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy

  known factual inaccuracies.





  3.5. Application of Additional Terms



  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity

  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.

  However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any

  Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,

  indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby

  agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such

  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You

  offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of

  liability specific to any jurisdiction.





4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation

---------------------------------------------------



If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with

respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or

regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the

maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they

affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all

distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent

prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently

detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.





5. Termination

--------------



  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You

  fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then

  the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are

  reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and

  finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such

  Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means

  prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your

  grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such

  Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this

  is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License

  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your

  receipt of the notice.



  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent

  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and

  cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly

  infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all

  Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall

  terminate.



  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user

  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been

  validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to

  termination shall survive termination.





6. Disclaimer of Warranty

-------------------------



Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without

warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without

limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,

merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as

to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any

Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume

the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of

warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered

Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.





7. Limitation of Liability

--------------------------



Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including

negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who

distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct,

indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character

including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work

stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial

damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility

of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for

death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent

applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the

exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion

and limitation may not apply to You.





8. Litigation

-------------



Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a

jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and

such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference

to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a

party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.





9. Miscellaneous

----------------



This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter

hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such

provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be

construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against

a Contributor.





10. Versions of the License

---------------------------





  10.1. New Versions



  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3,

  no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new

  versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version

  number.





  10.2. Effect of New Versions



  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the

  License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the

  terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.





  10.3. Modified Versions



  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a

  new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of

  this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of

  the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from

  this License).





  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary

  Licenses



  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With

  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice

  described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.





Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice

-------------------------------------------



  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License,

  v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can

  obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.



If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then

You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant

directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.



You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.





Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice

---------------------------------------------------------



  This Source Code Form is "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses", as defined

  by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

Python Software Foundation License 2.3

(libpython3.6-stdlib 3.6.8, python-ldap 3.1.0)



Python 2.3.3 license

====================



This is the official license for the Python 2.3.3 release:



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE

--------------------------



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting

Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a

successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author,

although it includes many contributions from others.



In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National

Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia

where he released several versions of the software.



In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to

form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs

team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation, see http://www.zope.com). 

In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was

formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related

Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.



All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open

Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also

been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.

Footnotes:



(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under     the

GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute     a modified

version without making your changes open source.  The     GPL-compatible licenses

make it possible to combine Python with     other software that is released under

the GPL; the others don't.



(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,     because its

license has a choice of law clause.  According to     CNRI, however, Stallman's

lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1     is "not incompatible" with the GPL.



Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to

make these releases possible.

Sun GPL With Classpath Exception v2.0

(Java Servlet API 4.0.1, JavaBeans Activation Framework 1.2.0, JAXB CORE 2.3.0.1)



"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2

==========================================



Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. are subject to the

following clarification and special exception to the GPL Version 2, but only

where Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the words

"Sun designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" exception as

provided by Sun in the License file that accompanied this code."



Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a

combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU

General Public License Version 2 cover the whole combination.



As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you permission

to link this library with independent modules to produce an executable,

regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and to copy and

distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you

also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions of the

license of that module. An independent module is a module which is not derived

from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you may extend this

exception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to do so. If

you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

Version 2, June 1991

--------------------



Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USAEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.



Preamble



The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share

and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to

guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the

software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most

of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors

commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by

the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your

programs, too.



When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our

General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to

distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),

that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change

the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can

do these things.



To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny

you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions

translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the

software, or if you modify it.



For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a

fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make

sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them

these terms so they know their rights.



We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer

you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or

modify the software.



Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that

everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the

software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to

know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by

others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.



Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish

to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually

obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent

this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free

use or not licensed at all.



The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification

follow.



TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION



  1.  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice

    placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms

    of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any such

    program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program

    or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing

    the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or

    translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included

    without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as

    "you".



    Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered

    by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program

    is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its

    contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been

    made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the

    Program does.



  2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as

    you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and

    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and

    disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this

    License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of

    the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.



    You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may

    at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.



  3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus

    forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such

    modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you

    also meet all of these conditions:



      a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating

        that you changed the files and the date of any change.



      b.  You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole

        or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,

        to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the

        terms of this License.



      c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,

        you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the

        most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an

        appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or

        else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute

        the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a

        copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive

        but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the

        Program is not required to print an announcement.)



    These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable

    sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably

    considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,

    and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as

    separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole

    which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be

    on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to

    the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.



    Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your

    rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the

    right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on

    the Program.



    In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with

    the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or

    distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this

    License.



  4. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under

    Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1

    and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:



      a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source

        code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above

        on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,



      b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to

        give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically

        performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the

        corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections

        1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,



      c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to

        distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only

        for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in

        object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with

        Subsection b above.)



    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making

    modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all

    the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface

    definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and

    installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source

    code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in

    either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,

    and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that

    component itself accompanies the executable.



    If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to

    copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the

    source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,

    even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the

    object code.



  5. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as

    expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,

    sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically

    terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received

    copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses

    terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.



  6. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.

    However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the

    Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you

    do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the

    Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of

    this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,

    distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.



  7. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),

    the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to

    copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.

    You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of

    the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance

    by third parties to this License.



  8. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent

    infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),

    conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or

    otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse

    you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to

    satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other

    pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the

    Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit

    royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies

    directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both

    it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the

    Program.



    If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any

    particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and

    the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.



    It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents

    or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;

    this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free

    software distribution system, which is implemented by public license

    practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of

    software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent

    application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or

    she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee

    cannot impose that choice.



    This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a

    consequence of the rest of this License.



  9. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain

    countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original

    copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an

    explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so

    that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.

    In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the

    body of this License.



  10. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the

    General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar

    in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new

    problems or concerns.



    Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program

    specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later

    version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of

    that version or of any later version published by the Free Software

    Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,

    you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.



  11. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs

    whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for

    permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software

    Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make

    exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of

    preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of

    promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.



    NO WARRANTY



  12. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR

    THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE

    STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE

    PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,

    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND

    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND

    PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,

    YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.



  13. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL

    ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE

    THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY

    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE

    OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR

    DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR

    A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH

    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.



    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS



How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs



If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use

to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which

everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.



To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach

them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of

warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer

to where the full notice is found.



one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.Copyright (C)



This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License

as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2

of the License, or (at your option) any later version.



This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the

GNU General Public License for more details.



You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software

Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA



Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.



If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it

starts in an interactive mode:



Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author

Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details

type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome

to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'

for details.



The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts

of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be called

something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or

menu items--whatever suits your program.



You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,

if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a

sample; alter the names:



Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright

interest in the program `Gnomovision'

(which makes passes at compilers) written

by James Hacker.



signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

Ty Coon, President of Vice



This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into

proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider

it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If

this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead

of this License.
